This personal project aims to showcase the games I have made in the past, share information about myself, and if they choose, submit a form to contact me for a variety of different reasons.

 with button presses.
- The project features a modal window that opens when you press the button labeled "Contact Me" inside of the fixed-bottom portion of the screen.

- The button labeled "Submit" accordingly submits the data inside the form to FormSpree.io.

# Technologies: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

# Ideas for Future Improvement: 
1. Improving pre-existing styles to better match the theme of the website.
2. Adding more visually enticing decals to the background to keep the user experience more satisfied.
3. Finding better images to replace the existing ones I either have made or found(that are free to use).
4. Having more of a variety to the websites UI containers and new styles/fonts.
